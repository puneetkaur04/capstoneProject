            <h1 id="title">What occurs if America’s Supreme Court overturns women’s right to abortion </h1>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>The United States Supreme Court's decision to make abortion illegal is a violation of women's rights because the poor, youth, immigrants, and people who have gone through intimate spouse exploitation are denied safe abortion care and are greatly impacted by circumstances concerning finance. The 1960s was a moment in time when the women's rights movement occurred. Roe v. Wade was a historic legal case delivered by the United States Supreme Court on January 22, 1973, where the court overturned a Texas law prohibiting abortion, essentially legalizing the procedure throughout the United States. The court ruled that a woman's right to an abortion was implied in the 14th Amendment's right to confidentiality and privacy. The court separated pregnancy into three trimesters and decided that the woman had absolute discretion over whether or not to terminate a pregnancy in the first trimester. In terms of maintaining the mother's well-being during the second trimester, the government could limit, but not prohibit, abortion. The state might restrict abortion in the third trimester to safeguard a fetus that could thrive beyond the womb unless the mother's condition and well-being were in jeopardy. Contrary to Roe v. Wade, abortion had been banned in most of the United States ever since the late 1800s. A myriad of states has implemented limitations on abortion rights following the 1973 decision.</p>
            <p>The leaked US Supreme Court perspective and beliefs that might overturn Roe imply that every US state can set its separate legislation about whether or not abortion should be legalized and under what conditions. If the Roe v. Wade decision is overturned, 26 US states, home to 58 million women, would almost definitely prohibit abortion. The right to abortion is protected in only 16 states. Countless individuals in the United States will be denied safe abortion care. The indigent, youth, black, undocumented, and individuals who have undergone intimate relationship abuse will be the hit hardest. They are more prone to have an unwanted pregnancy, die from pregnancy or its problems, and have the lowest accessibility to sexual and reproductive health care. The assumed effects of the possible overturn of the ruling appear to be igniting strong initiatives to preserve abortion accessibility in Democratic-leaning states.</p>

            <p> Biden asserted, “If the court does overturn Roe, it will fall on our nation’s elected officials at all levels of government to protect a woman’s right to choose." Vice President Kamala Harris stated, "How dare they, how dare they try to deny women their rights and their freedoms". She views the court's opinion on abortion as an attack on women's rights and believes that everyone should fight against it. Not only do significant government figures have stated against the court's perspective but also doctors like Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. It appears that the Supreme Court warned that no ultimate ruling had been reached. A final decision is not anticipated till the court's term ends in late June or early July. Since the information was released, opposing protest movements have filled the streets, with several portraying a demonstration outside the Supreme Court. The tactics utilized during the protest movements today are very similar to the tactics utilized during the civil rights movements. Nonviolence was an impactful tactic in hundreds of civil rights protests throughout the segregationist South. The bus boycott in Montgomery lasted 382 days. It came to an abrupt end once the United States Supreme Court proclaimed that bus segregation was unconstitutional. Similarly, nonviolent activities such as protests are utilized by individuals to express their disapproval of the idea to illegalize abortion. The Women's March has arranged a demonstration called Bans Off Our Bodies. According to a permit issued by federal authorities, an abortion rights protest with an approximate 17,000 individuals is intended for Saturday, May 14 on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. The demonstration in Washington is very similar to the March on Washington in 1963. Civil rights leaders from the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) urged the Kennedy administration to pass anti-racial discrimination legislation. President John F. Kennedy introduced a new civil rights bill in Congress. To hasten the procedure, civil rights leaders organized a massive march on Washington, D.C. There were more than 250,000 individuals from throughout the country who attended the march. All in all, the modern movements and civil rights movements utilize the same tactics of nonviolence to express their beliefs and opinions.</p>
